STM's dev environment is kinda hard to set up, it cost me a whole day just to get it to complie:

1) download and install STVD-STM8 (stands for "ST Visual Develop") This is the IDE for STM8 development (though not so well integrated for there is a couple of compilers missing)

2) download and extract STSW-STM8016, which is the programming library for STM8L series, note that different STM8 series have different libraries (such as STM8S)

3) install COSMIC compiler, which is the missing compiler I mentioned. (do this if you seem the STVD says cxstm8 is missing Also, I believe the raisonance compiler is also missing.)
